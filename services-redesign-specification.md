# Services Redesign Specification

## Overview
This document provides detailed specifications for redesigning the remaining service sections to match the established design patterns from WebDevelopment, AppDevelopment, and AppMaintenance sections.

## Design Pattern Analysis

### Established Patterns
1. **Visual-First Approach**: Each section features a prominent visual element (dashboard, mockup, or interactive component)
2. **Consistent Structure**: Header → Visual Element → Features Grid → CTA
3. **Animation Standards**: 0.6s duration, 0.1s stagger, power2.out easing, 24px y-offset
4. **Design Elements**: rounded-xl corners, semantic CSS variables, consistent spacing
