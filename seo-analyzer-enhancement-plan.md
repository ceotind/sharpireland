    schemaTypes: string[];
    qualityScore: number;
  };
  competitors: {
    serpFeatures: string[];
    estimatedBacklinks: number;
  };
}
```

### Database Considerations
For historical tracking and enhanced features:
```typescript
interface AnalysisHistory {
  id: string;
  url: string;
  report: EnhancedSEOReport;
  analyzedAt: Date;
  userId?: string; // For future account integration
}
```
